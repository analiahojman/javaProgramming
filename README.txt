My main goal with this application is to show my knowledge in Java programming.
The project is still in progress so some functionalities and tests are missing.


Description:
The application is a rest API that allows to build different informatives such as newspaper or digital newspaper with their articles/posts.
The rest API also allows to print all the informatives.

The code is in scr/main/java.
The tests are in src/test/java

To build and run the application you can use the following commands:
1) gradle build
2) ./gradlew bootRun


The main programming concepts that I am using to build the application are:
- Object Oriented Programming,
- Polymorphism,
- Hierarchy,
- API
- Rest services,
- Service Layer,
- Repository Layer,
- Unit testing.

Tech stack:
- Java
- Spring - for dependency injection
- Spring data JPA
- H2 database
- Spring boot
- Mockito - for testing
- Gradle - for dependency management and building the application
